### Yo ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris Bolton. I'm into a wide range of subjects, covering both Software and real-world problems.

Some of the things I'm working on right now:
- general purpose recommendation systems
- distributed computing on top of traditional web infrastructure
- interactive generative media (ex using GANs and language models)
