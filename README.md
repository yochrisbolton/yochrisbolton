### Yo 👋

I'm Chris Bolton. I'm into a wide range of subjects, covering both Software and real-world problems.

Some of the things I'm interested in:
- general purpose recommendation systems
- distributed computing on top of traditional web infrastructure
- interactive generative media (ex using GANs and language models)

Right now working on an interactive narrative game set in a low fantasy setting, inspired ny fables like those from Aesop 🐭
